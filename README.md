## Introduction

     Re-Hosting current landscape of the customer from his traditional data center (ie.ERP Tally in our case) to Cloud is the focus for this project, where in we are also proposing to the customer on the value added services which involves online & real-time comparative analysis, with other leading e-commerce portal. At present the client owns an online web portal with minimal information about his consumer products . We are hence deploying new features enabled with updated catalog details about the product ranges that the client owns along with other functionalities which include payment gateway integration, & end-to-end Order to process management to expand his business online in the current e-commerce market.
## Objective
•	To set up a distributed landscape that provides upscale and downscale of resources on cloud based environment (i.e. AWS Cloud in our case as a landing zone).

## Scope
