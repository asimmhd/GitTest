## Abstract


## Introduction

 Re-Hosting current landscape of the customer from his traditional data center (ie.ERP Tally in our case) to Cloud is the focus for this project, where in we are also proposing to the customer on the value added services which involves online & real-time comparative analysis, with other leading e-commerce portal. At present the client owns an online web portal with minimal information about his consumer products . We are hence deploying new features enabled with updated catalog details about the product ranges that the client owns along with other functionalities which include payment gateway integration, & end-to-end Order to process management to expand his business online in the current e-commerce market.
## Objective
* To set up a distributed landscape that provides upscale and downscale of resources on cloud based environment (i.e. AWS Cloud in our case as a landing zone).
* Implement a payment gateway where customers can make transactions easily.
* Enable the comparison of similar products among other e-commerce sites and formulate the pricing depending on the analysis.
## Scope
To develop WebApp application for a retail customer hosting his content for consumer products and design a landscape which is flexible to withhold the load on the Infrastructure during peak hours of the business. Also involves implementing the objectives mentioned above to sustain the current market trends

## HardwareAndSoftwareSpecification

* Minimum Hardware Requirement:
    * Operating System:Windows server R2 Edition-2016
    * CPU:4core
    * Memory:16GB
    * Storage:500GB(Ephermal)
    * .NET Version:.NET 4.5+NET3.5(added via system roles)
    * AWS-Region:Oregon(US West Region)

## Systemanalysis

* Existingsystem
    * Involves only simple web hosting portal without payment gateway and comparative analysis engine.
    * It displays only contact information about client and business is teken place manually
* Proposedsystem
    * To build webApp development involving comparative analysis. ie (where the price of products are compared with e-commerce site)by using AWS technology
    * To display the results of comparing as per requirements.
